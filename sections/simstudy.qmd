## Simulation Study {#sec-simstudy}

1. Agg MNL

  - Simulate data ($\bfbeta_i = \bfbeta$), then:
  - recover parameters
  - compare to dichotomized dual-response
  - compare to constant-prob (if $W=5$ set $\alpha$'s such that $\Pr(y_i=w) = 1/5$ )

1. HB MNL

  - Same 4 things as above
  
1. Assessing $\alpha$ cut-points

  - May need to try extreme values for some $\alpha$'s
  - What happens when different consumers have different interpretation of the $W$ categories such that $\alpha$'s are not the same for all consumers?
