We take $h(\\symbfit{x}_j, \\symbfit{\\beta}_i) = \\symbfit{x}_j'\\symbfit{\\beta}_i$ but this specification is not required.\n",

    "The “zero”-th (or “outside”) good is special and is associated with a zero vector of good characteristics ($\\symbfit{x}_0 = \\mathbf{0}$) such that $h(\\symbfit{x}_0, \\symbfit{\\beta}_i)=0$. Consumers observe $\\symbfit{x}_j$ and $\\eta_{ij}$ for all “inside” goods ($j>0; j \\in \\mathcal{J}_i$), but they *do not* observe $\\eta_{i0}$.[1]\n",

    "\n",
    "Another common framework when soliciting consumer preferences is to directly ask consumers if $V_i \\ge 0$. This implicitly assumes that $\\eta_{i0} = 0$, so that consumers deterministically know whether or not the ‘’inside’’ good $j^*_i$ is preferred to the outside good. As we have already noted, our framework can nest that standard case by assuming that, rather than following a standard Gumbel distribution, $\\eta_0$ is instead a degenerate distribution. In such a case, all but 2 of the $W$ partitions are empty, and the non-empty partitions are $\\mathcal{W}_0 = \\left\\lbrace 0 \\right\\rbrace$ and $\\mathcal{W}_W = \\left\\lbrace 1\\right\\rbrace$, as $p_i \\in \\left\\lbrace 0, 1\\right\\rbrace$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We acknowledge that this requires a slight abuse of notation, as $\\mathcal{W}_w$ was defined above using left-closed intervals. These have the advantage of being invertible under the inverse-CDF mapping. In the degenerate case, we instead have $p\\left(w_i = W\\mid\\alpha,\\beta\\right) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\eta_{i0} < V_i\\right) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(V_i > 0\\right) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\exp\\left(\\overline{\\mu}\\right)\\right)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\eta$ encapsulates factors known to the consumer but not to the researcher that affect the consumer’s utility (eg, the positive or negative “status” from being observed purchasing or consuming the Diet Coke, or from not purchasing and consuming a beverage). From the researcher’s perspective, $\\eta_j$ and $\\eta_0$ are assumed to be independent of $x$ and modeled as random variables with cumulative distribution functions $F(\\eta_j)$ and $F(\\eta_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the difference in utility as $U^* = U_j - U_0 = x_j'\\beta + \\eta^*$ where $x_0 = 0$ and $\\eta^* = \\eta_j - \\eta_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consumer does not report $U^*$ but rather reports $y$, a censoring of $U^*$ into one of $W$ discrete qualitative scale values $w=1,2,\\ldots,W$.

Here, $\\eta_0$ captures the consumer’s uncertainty about their future tastes. Given that utilities are ordinal and $\\eta_0$ is a common shock, it plays no role in the choice among the most preferred inside good $j^* \\in \\mathcal{J}_i$.\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "[2] For example, see \\[@Mcfadden_1981\\] and \\[@Cardell_1997\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "[3] While the parametrization of $\\eta_0 \\sim \\text{Gumbel}\\left(0,1\\right)$ preserves symmetry among the $J+1$ goods and is thus a natural choice, the framework can easily accommodate an alternative distribution for $\\eta_0$. For example, one could use an affine function of individual characteristics to accommodate individual-level variation in the propensity to prefer the outside good."
