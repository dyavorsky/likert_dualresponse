    "\n",
    "Another common framework when soliciting consumer preferences is to directly ask consumers if $V_i \\ge 0$. This implicitly assumes that $\\eta_{i0} = 0$, so that consumers deterministically know whether or not the ‘’inside’’ good $j^*_i$ is preferred to the outside good. As we have already noted, our framework can nest that standard case by assuming that, rather than following a standard Gumbel distribution, $\\eta_0$ is instead a degenerate distribution. In such a case, all but 2 of the $W$ partitions are empty, and the non-empty partitions are $\\mathcal{W}_0 = \\left\\lbrace 0 \\right\\rbrace$ and $\\mathcal{W}_W = \\left\\lbrace 1\\right\\rbrace$, as $p_i \\in \\left\\lbrace 0, 1\\right\\rbrace$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We acknowledge that this requires a slight abuse of notation, as $\\mathcal{W}_w$ was defined above using left-closed intervals. These have the advantage of being invertible under the inverse-CDF mapping. In the degenerate case, we instead have $p\\mleft(w_i = W\\mid\\alpha,\\beta\\mright) = \\mathbb{P}\\mleft(\\eta_{i0} < V_i\\mright) = \\mathbb{P}\\mleft(V_i > 0\\mright) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\exp\\left(\\overline{\\mu}\\right)\\right)$."
