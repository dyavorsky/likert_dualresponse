## Model {#sec-model}

### Set Up

Consumer $i=1,\ldots,N$ derives utility from good $j \in \mathcal{J}_i =  \lbrace 0,\ldots,J_i \rbrace$ with utility $u_{ij}$ given by
$$
u_{ij} = h(\x_j, \bfbeta_i) + \eta_{ij}.
$$
where $\x_j$ is a length-$P$ column vector of good characteristics, $\bfbeta_i$ is a length-$P$ column vector of consumer-specific taste parameters, and $\eta_{ij}$ encapsulates factors known to the consumer but unobserved by the researcher. We take $h(\x_j, \bfbeta_i) = \x_j'\bfbeta_i$ but this specification is not required.

The "zero"-th (or "outside") good is special and is associated with a zero vector of good characteristics ($\x_0 = \mathbf{0}$) such that $h(\x_0, \bfbeta_i)=0$. Consumers observe $\x_j$ and $\eta_{ij}$ for all "inside" goods ($j>0; j \in \mathcal{J}_i$), but they _do not_ observe $\eta_{i0}$.

The consumer first reports her preferred inside good, which is given by
$$
j^*_i = \arg\max_{j>0; \; j \in \mathcal{J}_i} u_{ij}.
$$

The consumer then reports a value $y_i$ on a discrete qualitative scale $w \in \mathcal{W} = \lbrace 1, \ldots, W \rbrace$ to reflect the probability $p_i$ that she would purchase $j^*$, i.e., that she prefers good $j^*_i$ to the outside good $j=0$. 

Apportion the range of $F$ into a number $W$ of intervals $\phi_w = \left[ \alpha_{w-1}, \alpha_w \right)$, where $\alpha_0 = 0$ and $\alpha_W = 1$. We assume that consumers share the definition of the qualitative scale and thus understand these intervals, whereas $\alpha_w$ for $0<w<W$ are unobserved by the researcher and are to be estimated.

Let $u_i^*$ denote the utility of good $j^*_i$ for consumer $i$. Consumers know $u_i^*$, but do not know $\eta_{i0}$, and thus the purchase probability from the consumer's perspective given by
$$
p_i = \Pr \left( \eta_{i0} < u_i^* \right) = F\left( u_i^* \right).
$$

The act of reporting the interval $y_i=w$ into which $p_i$ falls, reveals that
$p_i \in \left[\alpha_{w-1},\alpha_w\right)$ and is therefore equivalent to reporting that
$$
u_i^* \in \left[
    F^{-1} \left( \alpha_{w_{i-1}} \right), \;
    F^{-1} \left( \alpha_{w_i}     \right)
\right],
$$

### Probability Specification

We model $\eta_{ij} \iid \text{Gumbel} \left( 0,1 \right)$ with $\eta_{ij}$ assumed to be independent of both $\x_j$ and $\eta_{ik}$ for $k \ne j$.[^1] 

[^1]: This can be motivated by a framework in which $u_0 = 0$ and $u_{ij} = {\x_j}'\bfbeta_i + \eta_{ij} - \eta_0$ for $j>0; j \in \mathcal{J}_i$. Here, $\eta_0$ captures the consumer's uncertainty about their future tastes. Given that utilities are ordinal and $\eta_0$ is a common shock, it plays no role in the choice among the most preferred inside good $j^* \in \mathcal{J}_i$.

From the consumer's perspective,
$$
p_i = \Pr \left( \eta_{i0} < u_i^* \right) = F_{\text{Gumble}\left(0,1\right)} \left( u_i^* \right).
$$
and $\Pr(y_i=w)$ is given by
$$
\Pr(y_i=w)
= 
F_{\text{Gumbel}\left(0,1\right)} \left( F^{-1}_{\text{Gumbel}\left(0,1\right)} \left( \alpha_w \right) \right) - 
F_{\text{Gumbel}\left(0,1\right)} \left( F^{-1}_{\text{Gumbel}\left(0,1\right)} \left( \alpha_{w-1} \right) \right)
=
\alpha_w - \alpha_{w-1}.
$$

From the researcher's perspective, the unobserved likelihood of purchase is
$$
p_i = \Pr \left(  u_i^* - \eta_{i0} > 0 \right) = \Pr \left( \varepsilon_i > 0 \right) = 1 - \Pr \left( \varepsilon_i < 0 \right)
$$
where $\varepsilon_i = u_i^* - \eta_{i0}$. As is well known,[^2] $\varepsilon_i$ follows a Gumbel distribution with location parameter $\overline{\mu}_i$ and scale parameter $1$, where
$$
\overline{\mu}_i = \ln \left( \sum_{j\in\mathcal{J}_i} \exp \left( {\x_j}'\bfbeta_i \right) \right).
$$ {#eq-max-mu}
and so the unobserved choice probability is
$$
p_i = 1 - F_{\text{Gumble} \left( \overline{\mu}_i, 1 \right)} \left( \varepsilon_i \right).
$$

[^2]: See, e.g., [@Mcfadden_1981] or [@Cardell_1997].

Therefore, the probability that consumer $i$ reports $y_i=w$ is
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Pr \left( u_i^* \in \phi_{w\left( i \right)} \right) 
    &= F_{\text{Gumbel} \left( \overline{ \mu, 1 } \right) } \left( F^{-1}_{\text{Gumbel} \left( 0, 1 \right) } \left( \alpha_{w_i} \right) \right) - 
       F_{\text{Gumbel} \left( \overline{ \mu, 1 } \right) } \left( F^{-1}_{\text{Gumbel} \left( 0, 1 \right) } \left( \alpha_{w_i-1} \right) \right) \\
    &= \left( \alpha_{w_i} \right)^{\exp \left( \overline{\mu} \right)} - 
       \left({\alpha_{w_i-1}} \right)^{\exp \left( \overline{\mu} \right)}.
\end{aligned}
$$

We note that, while the parametrization of $\eta_0 \sim \text{Gumbel}\left(0,1\right)$ preserves symmetry among the $J+1$ goods and is thus a natural choice, the framework can easily accommodate an alternative distribution for $\eta_0$. For example, one could use an affine function of individual characteristics to accommodate individual-level variation in the propensity to prefer the outside good.
