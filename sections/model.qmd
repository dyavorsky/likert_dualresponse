## Model {#sec-model}

Consumers are indexed by $i=1,2,\ldots\,I$. Goods are indexed by $j=1,2,\ldots\,J$ and each good is characterized by a vector of characteristics $x_j$. Each consumer has: (i) taste parameters $\beta_i$, (ii) a good-specific taste shock $\varepsilon_{ij}$, and (iii) a good-specific taste shock $\nu_{ij}$. The outside good is indexed with $j=0$ and $x_j = \mathbf{0}$.        
Consumer $i$ derives utility $U_{ij}$ from good $j$, where
$$
    U_{ij} = \exp\left\lbrace {x_j}' \beta_{i} + \nu_{ij} + \varepsilon_{ij} \right\rbrace.
$$
For each consumer $i$, the econometrician observes:
* The most preferred good $j \in \left\lbrace 1, 2, \ldots\,J\right\rbrace$, denoted $j_i^{(1)}$. Let $t_i = e_{j^{(1)}}$ represent the ``one-hot'' encoding of consumer $i$'s choice of good $j^{(1)}$;
* A signal related to the probability that the consumer prefers the outside good $j=0$. This signal takes the form of an ordinal scale $w\in{}\left\lbrace1,2,\ldots\,W\right\rbrace$. Higher $w_i$ corresponds to increased probability of choosing $j_i^{(1)}$ over the outside good 0.
In addition, the econometrician observes the matrix of good characteristics $\symbfit{x}$.
