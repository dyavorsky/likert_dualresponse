## Model {#sec-model}

### General Specification

Consumer $i=1,\ldots,N$ derives utility from good $j \in \mathcal{J}_i =  \lbrace 0,\ldots,J_i \rbrace$ with utility $u_{ij}$ given by
$$
u_{ij} = h(\symbfit{x}_j, \symbfit{\beta}_i) + \eta_{ij}.
$$

where $\symbfit{x}_j$ is a vector of good characteristics, $\symbfit{\beta}_i$ is a vector of consumer-specific taste parameters, and $\eta_{ij}$ encapsulates factors known to the consumer but not to the researcher that affect the consumer’s utility and are modeled as $\eta_{ij} \sim \text{Gumbel} \left( 0,1 \right)$ with $\eta_{ij}$ assumed to be indepedent of both $x_j$ and $\eta_{ij'}$ for $j' \ne j$. We take $h(\symbfit{x}_j, \symbfit{\beta}_i) = \symbfit{x}_j'\symbfit{\beta}_i$ but this specification is not required.

The "zero"-th (or "outside") good is special and is associated with a zero vector of good characteristics ($\symbfit{x}_0 = \mathbf{0}$) such that $h(\symbfit{x}_0, \symbfit{\beta}_i)=0$. Consumers observe $\symbfit{x}_j$ and $\eta_{ij}$ for all "inside" goods ($j>0; j \in \mathcal{J}_i$), but they _do not_ observe $\eta_{i0}$.[^1]

[^1]: This can be motivated by a framework in which $u_0 = 0$ and $u_{ij} = {x_j}'\beta_i + \eta_{ij} - \eta_0$ for $j>0; j \in \mathcal{J}_i$. Here, $\eta_0$ captures the consumer's uncertainty about their future tastes. Given that utilities are ordinal and $\eta_0$ is a common shock, it plays no role in the choice among the most preferred inside good $j^* \in \mathcal{J}_i$.]

Consumers first report their preferred inside good among, which is given by
$$
j^*_i = \arg\max_{j>0; j \in \mathcal{J}_i} u_{ij}.
$$

Let $u_i^*$ denote the utility of good $j^*_i$ for consumer $i$ and let $t_i = e_{j_i^*}$ indicate the "one-hot" encoding of the most-preferred inside good (ie, $t_i$ is a vector with $J_i-1$ zeros and $1$ one).

Second, consumers report a value $y_i$ on a discrete qualitative scale $w \in \mathcal{W} = \lbrace 1, \ldots, W \rbrace$ to indicate the probability that they prefer good $j^*_i$ to the outside good 0. Consumers know $u_i^*$, but do not know $\eta_{i0}$, and thus this probability is given by
$$
p_i = \Pr \left( \eta_{i0} < u_i^* \right).
$$

Each consumer reports the interval $y_i=w$ into which $p_i$ falls
$$
y_i = w \hspace{1ex} \text{s.t.} \hspace{1ex} p_i \in \left[\alpha_{w-1},\alpha_w\right).
$$

As is well known,[^2] $u_i$ follows a Gumbel distribution with location parameter $\overline{\mu}_i$ and scale parameter $1$, where
$$
\overline{\mu}_i = \ln\left( \sum_{j\in\mathcal{J}} \exp\left({X_j}'\beta_i\right)\right).
$$ {#eq-max-mu}

[^2]: For example, see [@Mcfadden_1981] and [@Cardell_1997].

Under these assumptions, we have $p_i = F\left( u_i^* \right)$ with $F$ as the $\text{Gumbel} \left( 0,1 \right)$ distribution.

The consumer's report of $y_i=w$ is therefore equivalent to reporting that
$$
    u_i^* \in \left[
        F^{-1}_{\text{Gumbel}\left(0\right)}\left(\alpha_{w\left(i\right)-1}\right),
        F^{-1}_{\text{Gumbel}\left(0\right)}\left(\alpha_{w\left(i\right)}\right)
    \right),
$$
where we omit the common scale parameter for brevity.

This occurs with probability
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Pr \left( u_i^* \in \mathcal{W}_{w\left( i \right)} \right) 
    &= F_{\text{Gumbel} \left( \overline{ \mu } \right) } \left( F^{-1}_{\text{Gumbel} \left( 0 \right) } \left( \alpha_{w \left( i \right)} \right) \right) - 
       F_{\text{Gumbel} \left( \overline{ \mu } \right) } \left( F^{-1}_{\text{Gumbel} \left( 0 \right) } \left( \alpha_{w \left( i \right) - 1} \right) \right) \\
    &= \left( \alpha_{w \left( i \right)} \right)^{\exp \left( \overline{\mu} \right)} - 
       \left({\alpha_{w \left( i \right)-1}} \right)^{\exp \left( \overline{\mu} \right)}.
\end{aligned}
$$

This is $p\left(w_i\mid \alpha, \beta\right)$, the conditional likelihood of $w_i$.[^3]

[^3]: While the parametrization of $\eta_0 \sim \text{Gumbel}\left(0,1\right)$ preserves symmetry among the $J+1$ goods and is thus a natural choice, the framework can easily accommodate an alternative distribution for $\eta_0$. For example, one could use an affine function of individual characteristics to accommodate individual-level variation in the propensity to prefer the outside good.


### Comment: Relation to the [@Brazell_2006] Dual Response Model

Another common framework when soliciting consumer preferences is to directly ask consumers if $V_i \ge 0$. This implicitly assumes that $\eta_{i0} = 0$, so that consumers deterministically know whether or not the ''inside'' good $j^*_i$ is preferred to the outside good. As we have already noted, our framework can nest that standard case by assuming that, rather than following a standard Gumbel distribution, $\eta_0$ is instead a degenerate distribution. In such a case, all but 2 of the $W$ partitions are empty, and the non-empty partitions are $\mathcal{W}_0 = \left\lbrace 0 \right\rbrace$ and $\mathcal{W}_W = \left\lbrace 1\right\rbrace$, as $p_i \in \left\lbrace 0, 1\right\rbrace$.

We acknowledge that this requires a slight abuse of notation, as $\mathcal{W}_w$ was defined above using left-closed intervals. These have the advantage of being invertible under the inverse-CDF mapping. In the degenerate case, we instead have $p\left(w_i = W\mid\alpha,\beta\right) = \mathbb{P}\left(\eta_{i0} < V_i\right) = \mathbb{P}\left(V_i > 0\right) = 1 - \exp\left(-\exp\left(\overline{\mu}\right)\right)$.


### Comment: Nesting a Single-Good Specification

Suppose there are two goods: good $j$ and good $0$. For example, suppose good $j$ is Diet Coke and good 0 is the "outside option" of not purchasing the beverage.

These goods provide utility of 

- $U_j = x_j'\beta + \eta_j$ and 
- $U_0 = x_0'\beta + \eta_0$. 

$x$ is observed by both the consumer and the researcher (eg, the price $x_j$ of the Diet Coke and the price of not making a purchase $x_0=0$); $\beta$ are taste parameters known to the consumer, but not to the researcher that are to be estimated (eg, her price sensitivity). 

$\eta$ encapsulates factors known to the consumer but not to the researcher that affect the consumer's utility (eg, the positive or negative "status" from being observed purchasing or consuming the Diet Coke, or from not purchasing and consuming a beverage). From the researcher's perspective, $\eta_j$ and $\eta_0$ are assumed to be independent of $x$ and modeled as random variables with cumulative distribution functions $F(\eta_j)$ and $F(\eta_0)$.

We define the difference in utility as $U^* = U_j - U_0 = x_j'\beta + \eta^*$ where $x_0 = 0$ and $\eta^* = \eta_j - \eta_0$.

The consumer does not report $U^*$ but rather reports $y$, a censoring of $U^*$ into one of $W$ discrete qualitative scale values $w=1,2,\ldots,W$. Suppose, for example, that the consumer reports the middle level ($y=2$) out of three available (labeled, "unlikely" for $w=1$, "somewhat likely" for $w=2$, and "very likely" for $w=3$).

The $W$ levels of the qualitative scale are separated at values $\mu_w$ such that $-\infty < \mu_1, \mu_2, \ldots, \mu_W = \infty$, with $\mu_w, w=1,2,\ldots,W$ as parameters to be estimated. 

Then we have that 
$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Pr \left( y=w \right) 
    &= \Pr \left(\mu_{w-1} < U^* < \mu_w \right) \\
    &= \Pr \left(\mu_{w-1} < x_j'\beta + \eta^* < \mu_w \right) \\
    &= \Pr \left(\mu_{w-1} - x_j'\beta < \eta^* < \mu_w - x_j'\beta \right) \\
    &= F(\mu_w - x_j'\beta) - F(\mu_{w-1} - x_j'\beta)
\end{aligned}
$$

Define $t_w \in \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace$ as indicators with $t_w=1$ when $y=w$. The individual likelihood is then 

$$
\prod_{w=1}^W =  \left[ F(\mu_w - x_j'\beta) - F(\mu_{w-1} - x_j'\beta) \right]^{t_w}
$$
 


### Sketch of Estimation

\begin{itemize}
    \item Specify hyper-parameters governing the prior distribution of $\left(\symbf{\pi}, \symbf{\beta}\right)$. There is a relatively large amount of flexibility in the prior distribution over $\beta$. $\symbf{\pi} \sim \text{Dirichlet}$ deterministically maps to $\symbf{\alpha}$.
    \item (First Branch) Given draws of $\left(\alpha, \beta\right)$, the probability that consumer $i$ reports $j^*_i$ is given by a softmax
        $$
        p\left(j^*_i \mid \alpha, \beta\right) = p\left(j^*_i \mid \beta\right) = \frac{\exp\left({X_j}'\beta_i\right)}{\sum_{j'\in\mathcal{J}}\exp\left({X_{j'}}'\beta_i\right)}
        $$
    \item (Second Branch) Given $\left(\alpha, \beta\right)$, the probability that consumer $i$ reports $w_i$ is given by
    $$
        p\left(w_i \mid \alpha,\beta, j^*_i\right) = p\left(w_i\mid \alpha, \beta\right) =  \left({\alpha_{w\left(i\right)}}\right)^{\exp\left(\overline{\mu}\right)} - \left({\alpha_{w\left(i\right)-1}}\right)^{\exp\left(\overline{\mu}\right)}
    $$
    where $\overline{\mu}_i\left(\beta_i\right)$ is a function of consumer $i$'s tastes $\beta_i$ and the design matrix $X$ (@eq-max-mu). Note that the observed choice $j^*_i$ is irrelevant for this likelihood.
\end{itemize}

Thus the overall likelihood (conditional on some draw of parameters) is
$$
    p\left(\left(j^*_i, w_i\right) \mid \alpha, \beta \right) = p\left(w_i \mid \alpha,\overline{\mu}_i\left(\beta\right) \right) \times p\left(j^* \mid \beta\right).
$$

Assume some universal partitioning of the unit interval into $W$ disjoint intervals with cutoffs denoted by the $\left(W+1\right)$-dimensional vector $\symbfit{\pi} \in \Delta^{W-1}$. Let $\symbfit{\alpha}$ denote the partial sums of $\symbfit{\pi}$, so that
$$
    \begin{array}{*9{c}}
       \symbfit{\alpha}  = \big\lbrace 0, & \pi_1, & \pi_1 + \pi_2, & \ldots, & \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^{w} \pi_{i}}, & \ldots, & 1\big\rbrace \\
         & & & & \alpha_w 
    \end{array}
$$
$$
    \vphantom{\bigcup_{w=1}^W} \mathcal{W}_w = \left[\alpha_{w-1}, \alpha_w\right)
$$
$$
    \bigcup_{w=1}^W \mathcal{W}_i = \left[0, 1\right)
$$
