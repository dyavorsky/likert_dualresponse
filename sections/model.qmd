## Model {#sec-model}

Assume some universal partitioning of the unit interval into $W$ disjoint intervals with cutoffs denoted by the $\left(W+1\right)$-dimensional vector $\symbfit{\pi} \in \Delta^{W-1}$. Let $\symbfit{\alpha}$ denote the partial sums of $\symbfit{\pi}$, so that
$$
    \begin{array}{*9{c}}
       \symbfit{\alpha}  = \big\lbrace 0, & \pi_1, & \pi_1 + \pi_2, & \ldots, & \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^{w} \pi_{i}}, & \ldots, & 1\big\rbrace \\
         & & & & \alpha_w 
    \end{array}
$$
$$
    \vphantom{\bigcup_{w=1}^W} \mathcal{W}_w = \left[\alpha_{w-1}, \alpha_w\right)
$$
$$
    \bigcup_{w=1}^W \mathcal{W}_i = \left[0, 1\right)
$$

Consumer $i$'s utility for good $j$ is given by
$$
    U_{ij} = {X_j}'\beta_i + \eta_{ij},\quad \eta_{ij} \sim \text{Gumbel}\mleft(0,1\mright)
$$
where $X$ is the design matrix of good characteristics and $X^j$ denotes the \textit{j}\textsuperscript{th} row of $X$. The ``zero''-th good is special and is associated with a zero vector of good characteristics. Consumers observe $X$ and $\eta$ for all goods $j \in \mathcal{J}$, but they \emph{do not} observe $\eta_{i0}$.\footnote{This can be motivated by a framework in which $U_0 = 0$ and $U_{ij} = {X_j}'\beta_i + \eta_{ij} - \eta_0$ for $j \in \mathcal{J}$. Here, $\eta_0$ captures the consumer's uncertainty about their future tastes. Given that utilities are ordinal and $\eta_0$ is a common shock, it plays no role in the choice among the most preferred good $j^* \in \mathcal{J}$.}

First, consumers report their preferred good in $\mathcal{J} = \left\lbrace 1, 2, \ldots\,, J\right\rbrace$, which is given by
$$
    t_i = e_{j^*_i}\ \text{s.t.}\ j^*_i = \arg\max_{j\in\mathcal{J}} U_{ij}.
$$
Let $V_i$ denote the utility of good $j^*_i$ for consumer $i$.

Second, consumers report the probability that they prefer good $j^*_i$ to the outside good 0. Consumers know $V_i$, but do not know their draw of $\eta_{i0}$, and thus this probability is given by
$$
    p_i = \mathbb{P}\mleft(\eta_{i0} < V_i \mright).
$$
Each consumer reports the interval $\mathcal{W}_w$ into which $p_i$ falls
$$
    w_i = w\ \text{s.t.}\ p_i \in \left[\alpha_{w-1},\alpha_w\right).
$$

### Deriving the Likelihood

As is well known,[^1] $V_i$ follows a Gumbel distribution with location parameter $\overline{\mu}_i$ and scale parameter 1, where
$$
    \overline{\mu}_i = \ln\left( \sum_{j\in\mathcal{J}} \exp\left({X_j}'\beta_i\right)\right) \label{#eqn:max_mu}.
$$

Under these assumptions, we have
$$
    p_i = F_{\text{Gumbel}\mleft(0,1\mright)}\mleft(V_i\mright)
$$
The consumer's report of $w_i$ is therefore equivalent to reporting that
$$
    V_i \in \left[
        F^{-1}_{\text{Gumbel}\mleft(0\mright)}\mleft(\alpha_{w\mleft(i\mright)-1}\mright),
        F^{-1}_{\text{Gumbel}\mleft(0\mright)}\mleft(\alpha_{w\mleft(i\mright)}\mright)
    \right),
$$
where we omit the common scale parameter for brevity.

This occurs with probability
\begin{align}
    \mathbb{P}\mleft(V_i \in \mathcal{W}_{w\mleft(i\mright)}\mright) &= F_{\text{Gumbel}\mleft(\overline{\mu}\mright)}\mleft(F^{-1}_{\text{Gumbel}\mleft(0\mright)}\mleft(\alpha_{w\mleft(i\mright)}\mright)\mright) - F_{\text{Gumbel}\mleft(\overline{\mu}\mright)}\mleft(F^{-1}_{\text{Gumbel}\mleft(0\mright)}\mleft(\alpha_{w\mleft(i\mright)-1}\mright)\mright) \\
    &= \left({\alpha_{w\mleft(i\mright)}}\right)^{\exp\left(\overline{\mu}\right)} - \left({\alpha_{w\mleft(i\mright)-1}}\right)^{\exp\left(\overline{\mu}\right)}.
\end{align}
This is $p\mleft(w_i\mid \alpha, \beta\mright)$, the conditional likelihood of $w_i$.[^2]

## Sketch of Estimation

\begin{itemize}
    \item Specify hyper-parameters governing the prior distribution of $\left(\symbf{\pi}, \symbf{\beta}\right)$. There is a relatively large amount of flexibility in the prior distribution over $\beta$. $\symbf{\pi} \sim \text{Dirichlet}$ deterministically maps to $\symbf{\alpha}$.
    \item (First Branch) Given draws of $\left(\alpha, \beta\right)$, the probability that consumer $i$ reports $j^*_i$ is given by a softmax
    \begin{equation}
        p\mleft(j^*_i \mid \alpha, \beta\mright) = p\mleft(j^*_i \mid \beta\mright) = \frac{\exp\left({X_j}'\beta_i\right)}{\sum_{j'\in\mathcal{J}}\exp\left({X_{j'}}'\beta_i\right)}
    \end{equation}
    \item (Second Branch) Given $\left(\alpha, \beta\right)$, the probability that consumer $i$ reports $w_i$ is given by
    \begin{equation}
        p\mleft(w_i \mid \alpha,\beta, j^*_i\mright) = p\mleft(w_i\mid \alpha, \beta\mright) =  \left({\alpha_{w\mleft(i\mright)}}\right)^{\exp\left(\overline{\mu}\right)} - \left({\alpha_{w\mleft(i\mright)-1}}\right)^{\exp\left(\overline{\mu}\right)}
    \end{equation}
    where $\overline{\mu}_i\mleft(\beta_i\mright)$ is a function of consumer $i$'s tastes $\beta_i$ and the design matrix $X$ provided in Equation~@eqn:max_mu.[^3]
\end{itemize}

Thus the overall likelihood (conditional on some draw of parameters) is
\begin{equation}
    p\mleft(\left(j^*_i, w_i\right) \mid \alpha, \beta \mright) = p\mleft(w_i \mid \alpha,\overline{\mu}_i\mleft(\beta\mright) \mright) \times p\mleft(j^* \mid \beta\mright).
\end{equation}

## Comment: Relation to the [@Brazell_2006] Dual Response Model

Another common framework when soliciting consumer preferences is to directly ask consumers if $V_i \ge 0$. This implicitly assumes that $\eta_{i0} = 0$, so that consumers deterministically know whether or not the ''inside'' good $j^*_i$ is preferred to the outside good. As we have already noted, our framework can nest that standard case by assuming that, rather than following a standard Gumbel distribution, $\eta_0$ is instead a degenerate distribution. In such a case, all but 2 of the $W$ partitions are empty, and the non-empty partitions are $\mathcal{W}_0 = \left\lbrace 0 \right\rbrace$ and $\mathcal{W}_W = \left\lbrace 1\right\rbrace$, as $p_i \in \left\lbrace 0, 1\right\rbrace$.

We acknowledge that this requires a slight abuse of notation, as $\mathcal{W}_w$ was defined above using left-closed intervals. These have the advantage of being invertible under the inverse-CDF mapping. In the degenerate case, we instead have $p\mleft(w_i = W\mid\alpha,\beta\mright) = \mathbb{P}\mleft(\eta_{i0} < V_i\mright) = \mathbb{P}\mleft(V_i > 0\mright) = 1 - \exp\left(-\exp\left(\overline{\mu}\right)\right)$.

[^1]: For example, see [@Mcfadden_1981] and [@Cardell_1997].
[^2]: While the parametrization of $\eta_0 \sim \text{Gumbel}\mleft(0,1\mright)$ preserves symmetry among the $J+1$ goods and is thus a natural choice, the framework can easily accommodate an alternative distribution for $\eta_0$. For example, one could use an affine function of individual characteristics to accommodate individual-level variation in the propensity to prefer the outside good.
[^3]: Note that the observed choice $j^*_i$ is irrelevant for this likelihood through ''Gumbel distribution magic''. Specifically, it is the ''memory-less'' property of the Gumbel that yields this property.
